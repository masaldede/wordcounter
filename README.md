# 📚 Word Frequency Counter

## 🚀 Purpose  
This is a simple Python script that reads a text file and identifies the most frequently occurring word. It demonstrates fundamental concepts like file handling, dictionaries, loops, and word counting techniques.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced  
- File input and reading lines  
- Dictionary-based word counting  
- String manipulation  
- Finding max values in key-value pairs  
- Conditional logic

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries

## 📋 Features  
- Reads any `.txt` file  
- Counts all words and their frequencies  
- Identifies and prints the word with the highest frequency  
- Includes multiple alternative methods for counting (commented out)

## 📦 How to Run
```bash
python wordcounter.py
Enter File: sample.txt
If you just press Enter, it defaults to sample.txt.

Enter File: sample.txt
the 56

💡 Learning Highlights
	•	How to read and parse text files
	•	Using dict.get() to simplify counting
	•	Comparing dictionary values to find the maximum
	•	Understanding and testing different counter methods

🛠️ Possible Improvements
	•	Add input validation for missing files
	•	Remove punctuation and make word counting case-insensitive
	•	Display top 5 or top 10 most common words
	•	Build a simple GUI or web interface

🎯 Educational Context

This project is often used in introductory Python courses to teach the power of dictionaries and data parsing. It’s a great exercise in practical text analytics for beginners.
