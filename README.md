# Word Frequency Counter

## Purpose  
This is a simple Python script that reads a text file and identifies the most frequently occurring word. It demonstrates fundamental concepts like file handling, dictionaries, loops, and word counting techniques.

## Key Concepts Practiced  
- File input and reading lines  
- Dictionary-based word counting  
- String manipulation  
- Finding max values in key-value pairs  
- Conditional logic

## Technologies Used  
- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries

## Features  
- Reads any `.txt` file  
- Counts all words and their frequencies  
- Identifies and prints the word with the highest frequency  
- Includes multiple alternative methods for counting (commented out)

## How to Run
```bash
python wordcounter.py
Enter File: sample.txt
If you just press Enter, it defaults to sample.txt.

Enter File: sample.txt
the 56

üí° Learning Highlights
	‚Ä¢	How to read and parse text files
	‚Ä¢	Using dict.get() to simplify counting
	‚Ä¢	Comparing dictionary values to find the maximum
	‚Ä¢	Understanding and testing different counter methods

üõ†Ô∏è Possible Improvements
	‚Ä¢	Add input validation for missing files
	‚Ä¢	Remove punctuation and make word counting case-insensitive
	‚Ä¢	Display top 5 or top 10 most common words
	‚Ä¢	Build a simple GUI or web interface

üéØ Educational Context

This project is often used in introductory Python courses to teach the power of dictionaries and data parsing. It‚Äôs a great exercise in practical text analytics for beginners.
